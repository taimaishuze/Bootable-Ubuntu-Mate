# Create a bootable persistent Linux flash drive

# Downloaded image file from https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/
# Downloaded multiboot USB creater from https://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/

# Use Windows disk management utility to format create partition with FAT32.
# I created 8gb partition for Ubuntu Mate and have enough memory for storage.
# Run YUMI multiboot usb creater and select distro and image file (this image should be in your download file or
# wherever you downloaded image to).

# Set your persistent file size.
# Let YUMI do its magic.

# Reboot and go into your boot order options
# Set boot order to boot to USB.
# You should go into a screen that will allow you to select the image file to boot.

# With YUMI, I was able to create 2 seperate bootable OS; one to boot into Ubuntu Mate and the other partition to boot into Windows 10
# in the event that my system crashes.

# I hope this helps someone else since it took me the weekend and crashing my computer to get this to work. :)
